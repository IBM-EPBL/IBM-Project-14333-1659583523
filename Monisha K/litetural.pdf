A Literature Review of Efficient Water Quality Analysis and Prediction using Machine Learning
This research explores the methodologies that have been employed to help solve problems related to water quality. Typically, conventional lab analysis and statistical analysis are used in research to aid in determining water quality, while some analyses employ machine learning methodologies to assist in finding an optimized solution for the water quality problem. Local research employing lab analysis helped us gain a greater insight into the water quality problem in Pakistan. In one such research study, Daud et al. [5] gathered water samples from different areas of Pakistan and tested them against different parameters using a manual lab analysis and found a high presence of E. coli and fecal coliform due to industrial and sewerage waste. Alamgir et al. [6] tested 46 different samples from Orangi town, Karachi, using manual lab analysis and found them to be high in sulphates and total fecal coliform count.
After getting familiar with the water quality research concerning Pakistan, we explored research employing machine learning methodologies in the realm of water quality. When it comes to estimating water quality using machine learning, Shafi et al. [7] estimated water quality using classical machine learning algorithms namely, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks (NN), Deep Neural Networks (Deep NN) and k Nearest Neighbors (kNN), with the highest accuracy of 93% with Deep NN. The estimated water quality in their work is based on only three parameters: turbidity, temperature and pH, which are tested according to World Health Organization (WHO) standards. Using only three parameters and comparing them to standardized values is quite a limitation when predicting water quality. Ahmad et al. [8] employed single feed forward neural networks and a combination of multiple neural networks to estimate the WQI.  They used 25 water quality parameters as the input. Using a combination of backward elimination and forward selection selective combination methods, they achieved an R2 and MSE of 0.9270, 0.9390 and 0.1200, 0.1158, respectively. The use of 25 parameters makes their solution a little immoderate in terms of an inexpensive real time system, given the price of the parameter sensors. Sakizadeh [9] predicted the WQI using 16 water quality parameters and ANN with Bayesian regularization. His study yielded correlation coefficients between the observed and predicted values of 0.94 and 0.77, respectively.Abyaneh [10] predicted the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) using two conventional machine learning methodologies namely, ANN and multivariate linear regression. They used four parameters, namely pH, temperature, total suspended solids (TSS) and total suspended (TS) to predict the COD and BOD. Ali and Qamar [11] used the unsupervised technique of the average linkage (within groups) method of hierarchical clustering to classify samples into water quality classes.However, they ignored the major parameters associated with WQI during the learning process and they did not use any standardized water quality index to evaluate their predictions. Gazzaz et al. [4] used ANN to predict the WQI with a model explaining almost 99.5% of variation in the data. They used 23 parameters to predict the WQI, which turns out to be quite expensive if one is to use it for an IoT system, given the prices of the sensors. Rankovic et al. [12] predicted the dissolved oxygen (DO) using a feedforward neural network (FNN). They used 10 parameters to predict the DO, which again defeats the purpose if it has to be used for a real-time WQI estimation with an IoT system.
